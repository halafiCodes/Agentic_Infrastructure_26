# Agentic Trajectory and Growth Evidence

## Purpose
This document records evidence of agentic workflow growth over time.

## Evidence Checklist
- MCP Sense logs or output panel screenshots.
- IDE chat history files (if exported).
- Notes on multi-step orchestration and debugging sessions.
- Timeline of key milestones across multiple days.

## How To Capture Evidence
1) MCP Sense: open Output panel and select "Tenx MCP Sense", then copy a timestamped excerpt.
2) IDE chat: export or copy chat history snippets that show multi-step planning and debugging.
3) Redact secrets or personal data before pasting.

## Evidence Locations (Fill In)
- MCP Sense logs path: <add path or link>
- IDE chat history path: <add path or link>
- Screenshots folder: <add path or link>

## Growth Narrative (Template)
- Day 1: <summary of early workflows and basic tasks>
- Day 2: <summary of multi-step planning and orchestration>
- Day 3: <summary of debugging persistence and context engineering>

## Growth Narrative (Filled)
- Day 1: <fill with concrete tasks, tools used, and outcomes>
- Day 2: <fill with escalation handling, spec alignment, and corrections>
- Day 3: <fill with multi-step orchestration and sustained debugging>

## Validation Notes
- Do not include secrets or personal data in logs.
- Redact tokens before sharing.
