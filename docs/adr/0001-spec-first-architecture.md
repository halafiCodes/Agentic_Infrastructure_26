# ADR 0001: Spec-First Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Project Chimera prioritizes governance, traceability, and safety. Early implementation without stable specs risks drift and inconsistent agent behavior.

## Decision
All implementation is blocked until specs are ratified. Specs are the source of truth and must include contracts, data management, and governance requirements.

## Consequences
- Faster alignment and reduced rework.
- Clear acceptance criteria for tests.
- Implementation can be safely delegated to AI agents.
