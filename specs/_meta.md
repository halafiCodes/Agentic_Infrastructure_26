# Project Chimera Spec Meta

## Vision
Build a spec-driven, agentic infrastructure for autonomous influencer operations with strict safety, observability, and traceability.

## Constraints
- **Spec-First:** No implementation code until specs are ratified.
- **Traceability:** All agent behavior must be tied to explicit spec artifacts.
- **Safety:** Human approval gates required for publication workflows.

## Non-Goals
- Delivering a working content engine in this phase.
- Optimizing for cost; correctness and governance take priority.
